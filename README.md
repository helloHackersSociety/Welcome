# Welcome to helloHackers Society 👋🏼


## What is helloHackers Society? 

- Hackathon society at Manchester Metropolitan University.
- Welcoming to each and every student irrespective of the course they study, the year they are in or the level of                experience/knowledge they have.
- A play on word for "Hello World!", so "Hello Hackers!" would be a greeting to fellow hackers. 😋

## Goals

- try and make it easier for hackathon lovers to find people within the university with similar interests to:
  * form teams for hackathons
  * collaborate on side projects 
  * attend hackathon related workshops, talks and challenges
  
- organize hackathons, workshops, hack days, talks and challenges.

- also an attempt to destigmatize and spread awareness about the true meaning of the term "hacker" and the difference          between a hacker and a cracker.
   * Hackers build things 🛠, crackers break them 💔.
